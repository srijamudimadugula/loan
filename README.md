# Credit Risk Analysis

This project explores historical loan application data to help lending companies improve their credit risk assessment processes.

# Why This Project Matters

Lending institutions often struggle with incomplete credit histories, making it hard to accurately assess whether applicants will repay their loans. As a result, they risk:

- Losing business by rejecting good customers who are likely to repay.
- Suffering financial losses when high-risk applicants default.

By analyzing data patterns and identifying important risk factors, lenders can make smarter decisions that balance growth and stability.

# What This Project Does

This project focuses on:

- Cleaning and exploring loan application data.
- Visualizing patterns in customer behavior.
- Identifying key factors associated with default risk.

The analysis includes:

- Distribution of defaults vs. non-defaults.
- Correlation between income, credit history, and loan outcomes.
- Insights into missing data and potential data quality issues.
